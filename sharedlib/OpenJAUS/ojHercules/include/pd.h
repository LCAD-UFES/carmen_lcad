// Written by:	Tom Galluzzo (galluzzt@ufl.edu)
// Date:		09/08/09
// Description:	This file contains the skeleton C header file code for implementing the pd.c file

// How To Use This File:
// All comments labled "USER:" specify lines of code that the end user must change to implement thier individual component
// The end user must also change all functions and variables in this file begining with "pd"
// This substring must be changed to the component identifier acronym of the individual component, and
// this file should also be renamed likewise
// Ex: For a Primitive Driver component change all "pd" to "pd"
// Also Change all "PD" to your component acronym (ALL CAPS)
