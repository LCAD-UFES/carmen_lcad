# Steps to install Heltec ESP32&ESP8266 Arduino support on Windows
**Tested on 32 and 64 bit Windows 10 machines**

Before operation, please make sure Git and Arduino are correctly installed on you computer. If not, please refer to this document: [How to install Git and Arduino IDE](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/how_to_install_git_and_arduino.html)

&nbsp;

**Executed commands MUST under the ```[YOUR_USER_NAME]/Documents/Arduino/hardware``` path!**

- Open a ```Git Bash``` session pointing to ```[YOUR_USER_NAME]/Documents/Arduino/hardware``` and execute `git clone https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/WiFi_Kit_series.git heltec `

 - The final development framework location should be ```[YOUR_USER_NAME]/Documents/Arduino/hardware/heltec```
 - Switch to the heltec directory via ```cd heltec``` and execute ```git submodule update --init --recursive```

Connect your ESP32 board to computer via a high quality USB cable and wait for the CP2102 drivers install automatically (or [install manually](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/establish_serial_connection.html)).

1. Start Arduino IDE
2. Select your board in ```Tools > Board``` menu `WiFi_Kit_32` or `WiFi_LoRa_32`, etc.
3. Select the COM port that the board is attached to
4. Compile and upload (You might need to hold the ```PRG``` button while uploading)

## Finish Arduino ESP8266 support on Windows
In the `/Documents/Arduino/hardware/heltec/esp8266/tools`, run the following command to finish ESP8266 tools chain install:

`python get.py`

After `get.py` running finish, the folder should like this:
