Program to control a robot with a "Logitech WingMan Cordless Rumble
Pad" (using Mike's Joystick-Segway-Module).

First of all one has to press the "start" button to activate the
joystick and the throttle control should initially be moved to the
left (slow/stop).


In contrast to the versions this program has two mode:

1) The normal mode in which the right joystick is used to set the
rotational velocity of the robot and the left one to control the
translational velocity of the robot.

Whenever on of the buttons R1, R2, L1, L2 is pressed the joystick
switches to the "throttle control" mode (back again in the same way):

2) In this mode the translational velocity is controlled by the
throttle control (close the button R1). The rotational velocity
control remains on the right joystick.  If the left joystick is moved
the robot performs stops (for security reasons). To invert the
translational velocity one can use the down-button on the "digital
8-pad".
