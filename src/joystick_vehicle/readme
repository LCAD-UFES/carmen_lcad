JOYROBOT

The JoyRobot module allows you to control Pearl
via a joystick. You can control both her base
and her head. JoyRobot is part of CARMEN.


==================================================
USAGE

Starting up the module:
	1) Start the central module on a computer
	2) If you want to be able to control the base along with the 
	   head you need to start the other modules (otherwise
	   you can skip this step).
	   To start each of these make sure the central module is running.
	   If you are running any of them on a different computer than central
	   do step 4. Then execute the modules with the flag -<robotname>
	   where robotname is the name of the robot you are controlling.  
	   See the scout, robot, and laser modules' documentation
	   for more information.
	3) ssh or log on to a machine with a joystick
	   (alder, peanut, and thyme)
	4) Set the CENTRALHOST environment variable to
	   the computer that you are running central on.
	5) run joyrobot
Using the joystick
	If you find "Mike's Joystick" it will have a number
	of labels on it.

	The labels correspond to the head functions.
	
	eyes:	sets which way the eyes are pointing
	blink:	toggles on and off background blinking and small eye motions
	think:	toggles on and off Pearl's "thinkers"
	neck:	this controls the position of the head.
		pressing upward will lift her face,
		downward lowers it.
		pressing left will turn her head leftwards from
		her own perspective, and right turns her
		head towards her right.
	smile:	changes her expression to a smile
	frown:	changes her expression to a frown

	The movement of the robot is controlled by this stick itself
	
	turning: to turn Pearl left (from her perspective) lean
		 the stick leftwards, right--rightwards
	moving:	 to move Pearl forwards press forwards on the stick
	You can also do a combination of these to get an arc.

=======================================
ERRORS/PROBLEMS/QUIRKS

1) Pearl will not back up because she has no sensors facing backwards.
2) The head does not moves smoothly when controlled by the joystick.
