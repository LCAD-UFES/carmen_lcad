# To Use the GSP RTK Reach on the Raspberry PI

# Add the Raspberry Pi-based access point to an existing network

In order to work as an access point, the Raspberry Pi will need to have access point software installed, along with DHCP server software to provide connecting devices with a network address. Ensure that your Raspberry Pi is using an up-to-date version of Raspbian (dated 2017 or later).

- Use the following to update your Raspbian installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
- Install all the required software in one go

```bash
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq hostapd
```
- Since the configuration files are not ready yet, turn the new software:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
sudo systemctl stop hostapd
```
- To ensure that an updated kernel is configured correctly after install, reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

- Configuring a static IP:

We are configuring a standalone network to act as a server, so the Raspberry Pi needs to have a static IP address assigned to the wireless port. This documentation assumes that we are using the standard 192.168.x.x IP addresses for our wireless network, so we will assign the server the IP address 192.168.4.1. It is also assumed that the wireless device being used is wlan0.

- To configure the static IP address, edit the dhcpcd configuration file with:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

- Go to the end of the file and edit it so that it looks like the following:

```
interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.13.1/24
nohook wpa_supplicant
```
- Now restart the dhcpcd daemon and set up the new wlan0 configuration:

```bash
sudo service dhcpcd restart
```

- Configuring the DHCP server (dnsmasq)

The DHCP service is provided by dnsmasq. By default, the configuration file contains a lot of information that is not needed, and it is easier to start from scratch. Rename this configuration file, and edit a new one:

```bash
sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```

- Type or copy the following information into the dnsmasq configuration file and save it:

```
	interface=wlan0        # Use the require wireless interface - usually
	wlan0
	dhcp-range=192.168.13.22,192.168.13.25,255.255.255.0,24h
        dhcp-authoritative
```
So, for wlan0, we are going to provide IP addresses between 192.168.4.2 and 192.168.4.20, with a lease time of 24 hours. If you are providing DHCP services for other network devices (e.g. eth0), you could add more sections with the appropriate interface header, with the range of addresses you intend to provide to that interface.

There are many more options for dnsmasq; see the dnsmasq documentation for more details.

Configuring the access point host software (hostapd)
You need to edit the hostapd configuration file, located at /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf, to add the various parameters for your wireless network. After initial install, this will be a new/empty file.


```bash
sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
```

- Add the information below to the configuration file. This configuration assumes we are using channel 7, with a network name of NameOfNetwork, and a password AardvarkBadgerHedgehog. Note that the name and password should not have quotes around them. The passphrase should be between 8 and 64 characters in length.

To use the 5 GHz band, you can change the operations mode from hw_mode=g to hw_mode=a. Possible values for hw_mode are:

```
a = IEEE 802.11a (5 GHz)
b = IEEE 802.11b (2.4 GHz)
g = IEEE 802.11g (2.4 GHz)
ad = IEEE 802.11ad (60 GHz).
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=NameOfNetwork
hw_mode=g
channel=7
wmm_enabled=0
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=AardvarkBadgerHedgehog
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
We now need to tell the system where to find this configuration file.
```

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd
```

- Find the line with #DAEMON_CONF, and replace it with this:

```
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
```

- Now start up the remaining services:

```bash
sudo systemctl start hostapd
sudo systemctl start dnsmasq
```

- Add routing and masquerade, edit /etc/sysctl.conf and uncomment this line: net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```
- Add a masquerade for outbound traffic on eth0:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A  POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

- Save the iptables rule.

```bash
sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"
```

- Edit /etc/rc.local and add this just above "exit 0" to install these rules on boot.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
Add the following content:

```
iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat

sudo systemctl start hostapd
sudo systemctl start dnsmasq
```

- If the following error occurs:

```
Failed to start hostapd.service: Unit hostapd.service is masked.
```
Run the following command:

```
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd.service
```


```bash
Reboot
```
